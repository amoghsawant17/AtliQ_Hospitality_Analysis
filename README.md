# Revenue Insights Hospitality - Power BI
In this Data Analysis project, I have studied a dataset related to the hospitality domain. AtliQ Grands is one of the prominent hotel chains in this industry. I have analyzed their hotel bookings and capacity data. And, I created a Power BI dashboard for Data Visualization.

## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

### Task List

## Learnt things from this Project 
- By referring to the different cancellation policies of different hotels, I understood that most of the hotels charge zero fees, only if the booking is canceled before three months of the arrival date. If the booking is canceled after that, the charges range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
- I Learned, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and a clear filter button in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection same as a website page navigation.
- Tried using the color palette and sticking with those colors throughout the dashboard ([Color palette link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/0766ad29adb2c5e898f3f3f3))

## Some Key Metrics
#### Week-on-Week (WoW) 
- It is a type of business metric that measures changes in a specific variable over one week compared to the previous week. It is a common way of tracking business performance over time and is particularly useful for analyzing trends and identifying areas where improvements can be made.
- Here are the metrics for which I found the WoW change %:
1. Revenue WoW change %: To get the revenue change percentage week over week.
2. Occupancy WoW change %: To get the occupancy change percentage week over week.
3. ADR WoW change %: To get the ADR (Average Daily rate) change percentage week over week.
4. RevPAR WoW change %: To get the RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) change percentage week over week.
5. Cancellation WoW change %: To get the Cancellation change percentage week over week.
6. DURN WoW change %: To get the DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights) change percentage week over week.
#### ADR 
- It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked or sold.
- ADR = Total Revenue/ Total rooms booked or sold
#### RevPAR
- RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue-generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands.
- RevPAR = Total Revenue/ Total Capacity
#### DSRN - Daily Sellable Room Nights
- This metric tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a period.
- DSRN = Total Capacity/ Number of days
#### DURN - Daily Utilized Room Nights
- This metric tells on average how many rooms are successfully utilized by customers for a day considering a period.
- DURN = Total Checked Out/ Number of days

#### Enhance Business Category:

#### Manage Luxury Category:

#### Optimize DURN:

#### Monitor Seasonal Trends:
- Stay vigilant about seasonal trends and adjust marketing and operational strategies accordingly to capitalize on peak seasons and minimize losses during slower periods.

#### Review and Adjust ADR:
- Continuously review and adjust the Average Daily Rate (ADR) to find the optimal balance between revenue and occupancy, considering the different categories and regions.

#### Capacity Planning:
