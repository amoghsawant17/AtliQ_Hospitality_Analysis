# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI
In this Data Analysis project, I have studied a dataset related to the hospitality domain. AtliQ Grands is one of the prominent hotel chains in this industry. I have analyzed their hotel bookings and capacity data. And, I created a PowerBI dashboard for Data Visualization.

## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Learnt things from this Project 
- By referring to different cancellation policies of different hotels, I understood that most of the hotels charges zero fees, only if the booking is canceled before three months of the arrival date. If the booking is canceled after that, the charges ranges from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
- I Learned, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and a clear filter button in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection same as a website page navigation.
- Tried using the color palette and sticking with those colors throughout the dashboard ([Color palette link](https://colorhunt.co/palette/0766ad29adb2c5e898f3f3f3))
